# Beehive Datalogger and 3D Temperature Visualization Project

Got tasked to make a datalogger to read the temperature inside of a beehive, which will then use the recorded information to visualize it using a webapp which I also got tasked to do.
The webapp took about 3 months and the datalogger about 4 months. I had plenty of experience with computer science but the engineering/design aspect was all new to me so it took me a while 
to get the hang of it.

## Version 1: Datalogger with analog sensors
#### Used analog sensors as those were the only ones available for a while. The digital sensors that I asked for took a long time to arrive.
